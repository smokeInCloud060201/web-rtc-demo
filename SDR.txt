Issue:
	- 2 devices (kioskMachine + Ipad) => How to know what screen are user using?
		Option 1: SSE + Restful =>
			- Ipad subcribe the SSE connection with server
			- Each times user navigate to another screen/pages in kioskMachine => sent a request to server
			 => Server sent a event message to redis channel
				Redis channel publish message to all subribers
					=> Each subcriber (Server pod) will find the ID => Send message(Active screen user's using) to Ipad 
			Pros:
				- Easy and quickly to setup
			Cons:
				- The SSE connection between Ipad and Server always on (24/24)
				- Kiosk machine will send many request to server side (each url location each request)
		Option 2: SSE + WebRTC + Restful
			- KioskMachine and Ipad will subcribe a connection to server
				=> KioskMachine and Ipad create a webRTC SDP offer (WebRTC Session Description Protocol offer)
				=> KioskMachine send a SDP offer to server
					 => Server sent a event message to redis channel
						Redis channel publish message to all subribers
							...
							Server sent KioskMachine's SPD offer to Ipad	
								=> Ipad offer then Send the Ipad's SPD to server
									=> Server send a Ipad's SPD to KioskMachine
										=> KioskMachine offer => Channel open => End SSE connection of KioskMachine and Ipad to server
			Pros:
				- Dont need to sent many request to server
				- Only open SSE connection in first time want to open a channel
			Cons:
				- The comunicate is Client to Client via Wifi - LAN, can be blocked by SP network retriction or policy (If SP network blocked => Can use public TURN from google server channel)
